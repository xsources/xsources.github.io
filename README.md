Python code source to simulate some percolation processes. Example of site percolation in 100x100 square lattice is shown here:

https://xsources.github.io/sitepercolation.html or https://xsources.github.io/sitepercol.html

where a phase transition is obseved near the percolation threshold pc=0.593
