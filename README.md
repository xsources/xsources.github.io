Python simution of site percolation in square lattice

We present here a percolation system in a (100x100) square lattice (left side). Our interactive python application computes and updates at each click on the "Next" button the following elements:
- the probability (p)
- the concentration (c) of "occupied sites"
- the size of the lagest component (LC), colored in red
At the percolation threshold pc=0.5927, the largest component spans the percolation system by joining two opposite sides of the square grid.

On the right side of the app, the percolation function θ(p) (the probability for a site to belong to the largest component) is plotted dot by dot, at each button click. 
The Python code source is displayed.

The phase transition is obseved near the percolation threshold at pc=0.593 in the  θ(p) function.
